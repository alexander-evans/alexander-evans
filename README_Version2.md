# Alexander Evans — Resume Website (ATS-friendly)

This repository contains a single-page, ATS-friendly resume site and a plain-text resume (resume.md). The HTML is structured with standard headings and simple lists to improve parsing by applicant tracking systems.

Files:
- index.html — ATS-friendly resume page (semantic headings, clear contact line, reverse-chronological experience)
- styles.css — minimal styling; does not interfere with content parsing
- script.js — small interactive helpers (theme toggle and current year). This script is optional for ATS/printing.
- resume.md — plain-text, ATS-optimized resume
- LICENSE — (optional) add if you want to publish

How to customize:
1. Open index.html and resume.md to update the Expected graduation year and any experience details or dates.
2. Keep section headings as-is (Professional Summary, Experience, Education, Skills) for best ATS compatibility.
3. Remove images, complex layouts, or tables if you will upload the HTML directly to an ATS — the current layout is deliberately simple.

Print / PDF:
- Use the "Print / Download PDF" button or press Ctrl/Cmd+P. Print styles are included for a clean export.

Next steps I can take for you:
- Replace [Year] with your expected graduation year and add any missing links (LinkedIn, GitHub).
- Produce a one-page PDF formatted specifically for ATS and recruiters.
- Prepare GitHub repository instructions or a deploy-ready commit.

To update the resume content, paste changes into resume.md and copy them into index.html. If you'd like, tell me your expected graduation year and any quantifiable achievements or metrics you want included, and I'll update the files.
